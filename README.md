Summary:

This project aims to understand how threads work and how to communicate between them.

Foreword:

Philosophy (from Greek, philosophia, literally "love of wisdom") is the study of general and fundamental questions about existence, knowledge,
values, reason, mind, and language. Such questions are often posed as problems to be studied or resolved. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras
(c. 570 â€“ 495 BCE). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument, and systematic presentation.
Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? Philosophers also pose more practical and
concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will?
